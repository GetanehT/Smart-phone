  ### Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users.

* I have used `##ffffff` & `##000000` as the primary and 
   secondary colours used for the sites text.
*   I have used `##` as the overlay used over the sites 
    background image. 
*   I have used ##3a3a3a for borders
*   I have used for pargraph ##f7f7f7 and #4CAF50
*  I have used `##rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)` as the box shadow 
  container section.

### Typography

* Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in 
  the site.
* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Roboto]('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900&display=swap');
* Roboto is a sans-serif font which has lovely clean lines. I 
 have chosen to use a sans-serif font for the body of the page 
 as studies have found that sans-serif fonts are generally more legible to read on a screen.


 ### Features
* Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
* Navigation menu for easy access to different sections.

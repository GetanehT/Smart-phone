  ## Design

### Colour Scheme

As the pages of the site have a background image, I wanted to keep the colour scheme used on the site quite small so as to not overwhelm users.

* I have used `#ffffff` & `##000000` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used `##5b5c5e` as the overlay used over the sites background image.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

 ### Features
*	Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.
*	Navigation menu for easy access to different sections.
*	Contact form for user feedback.
* Social media links for better connectivity.
